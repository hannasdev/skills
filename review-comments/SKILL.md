# Review Comments Skill

## Purpose

Handle review comments consistently and safely from intake to closure.

This skill is for the full loop:

1. Collect unresolved comments
2. Assess comment quality and impact
3. Decide what to implement vs question vs decline
4. Implement focused fixes
5. Validate changes
6. Resolve only addressed threads
7. Re-check unresolved count and CI

## Required process

Before applying fixes:

1. Fetch current unresolved review threads for the PR.
2. Group comments by category:
   - correctness issue
   - required improvement
   - optional suggestion
   - opinion/preference
   - ambiguous/conflicting feedback
3. Confirm each comment against actual code/docs behavior.
4. Decide response per comment:
   - implement now
   - ask clarifying question
   - explain why not implementing
5. Keep changes scoped to the reviewed concern.

After applying fixes:

1. Run relevant validation (lint/tests/docs generation as applicable).
2. Commit with a focused message.
3. Push branch updates.
4. Reply on each addressed thread with a concise resolution note (what changed + validation evidence), tailored to that thread by default.
5. Resolve only threads that are fully addressed.
6. Re-check unresolved thread count.
7. Re-check PR checks status.

## Non-negotiable rules

- Thread resolution checklist:
   - Do not resolve a thread before the fix is pushed.
   - Do not resolve a thread without a resolution reply comment unless explicitly requested by the user.
   - Do not resolve threads that are only partially addressed.
- Reply quality checklist:
   - Do not use one generic reply across unrelated threads; use shared wording only when comments address the same root cause or the same code section.
- Scope and intent checklist:
   - Do not batch unrelated refactors into review-response commits.
   - Do not blindly apply every reviewer request if it conflicts with product intent.
- Validation and clarity checklist:
   - Do not skip validation when behavior changes.
   - If feedback is ambiguous, ask for clarification instead of guessing.

## Assessment rubric

Use this rubric for each comment:

1. Is the claim technically correct?
2. Is the impact real in this repo's workflows?
3. Is the severity blocking, medium, or low?
4. Is there a minimal fix that avoids scope expansion?
5. What test or evidence proves the issue is fixed?

## Implementation guidance

- Prefer minimal, explicit fixes.
- Update tests for regressions and edge cases introduced by the comment.
- Update docs/workflow text when behavior contract changes.
- Keep API behavior backwards compatible unless a guard is necessary for safety.
- If introducing a guard, return a clear error code and next_step guidance.

## Helper script

Use the bundled helper to run the thread workflow consistently:

- Script: `skills/review-comment-resolution/scripts/review-comments.mjs`
- Behavior: strict (non-zero exit on invalid thread IDs, already-resolved IDs, and failing/pending PR checks)
- Commands:
   - `list` - show unresolved review threads (or all with `--all`)
   - `resolve` - comment + resolve specific thread IDs (thread-specific by default)
   - `status` - print unresolved count and run `gh pr checks`

Examples:

```bash
node skills/review-comment-resolution/scripts/review-comments.mjs list --pr 171
node skills/review-comment-resolution/scripts/review-comments.mjs resolve --pr 171 --ids PRRT_xxx,PRRT_yyy
node skills/review-comment-resolution/scripts/review-comments.mjs resolve --pr 171 --ids PRRT_xxx,PRRT_yyy --comment "Addressed in 1234abc. Added regression test."
node skills/review-comment-resolution/scripts/review-comments.mjs resolve --pr 171 --ids PRRT_xxx,PRRT_yyy --comment "Shared root cause fixed in 1234abc." --shared-comment
node skills/review-comment-resolution/scripts/review-comments.mjs resolve --pr 171 --ids PRRT_xxx,PRRT_yyy --comments-file /tmp/thread-comments.json
node skills/review-comment-resolution/scripts/review-comments.mjs status --pr 171
```

Minimal `--comments-file` example:

```json
{
   "PRRT_xxx": "Addressed in 1234abc. What changed: fixed numbering in SKILL.md. Validation: node --experimental-sqlite --test src/test/unit/review-comments-script.test.mjs.",
   "PRRT_yyy": "Addressed in 1234abc. What changed: added tag-normalization regression test. Validation: node --experimental-sqlite --test src/test/unit/review-bundles.test.mjs."
}
```

## Recommended command sequence (GitHub CLI)

Prefer the helper script above. Use raw commands only as fallback.

```bash
# 1) Get unresolved threads (raw GraphQL, paginated)
gh api graphql --paginate -f query='\
query($owner:String!, $name:String!, $pr:Int!, $endCursor:String) {\
   repository(owner:$owner, name:$name) {\
      pullRequest(number:$pr) {\
         reviewThreads(first:100, after:$endCursor) {\
            nodes {\
               id\
               isResolved\
               comments(first:20) { nodes { author { login } path line body url } }\
            }\
            pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }\
         }\
      }\
   }\
}' -f owner='hannasdev' -f name='mcp-writing' -F pr=<number>

# 2) Reply and resolve addressed thread IDs
gh api graphql -f query='mutation($threadId:ID!, $body:String!){addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input:{pullRequestReviewThreadId:$threadId, body:$body}){comment{id}}}' -f threadId='<thread_id>' -f body='Addressed in <commit>. Validation: <test command>'
gh api graphql -f query='mutation($id:ID!){resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$id}){thread{id isResolved}}}' -f id='<thread_id>'

# 3) Verify unresolved count and check status
gh pr checks <number> -R hannasdev/mcp-writing
```

## Output format for user updates

Use this structure when reporting progress:

```md
Findings
- <comment A>: valid/invalid, severity, planned action
- <comment B>: valid/invalid, severity, planned action

Changes made
- <file>: <what changed>

Validation
- <commands run>
- <results>

Review status
- unresolved threads: <count>
- checks: <pending/passing/failing>
```

## Completion criteria

A review-response pass is complete only when:

- Every blocking/resolved-now comment is fixed and pushed.
- Validation for changed behavior has passed (or clearly documented as not run).
- Only fully addressed threads are resolved.
- Remaining unresolved threads (if any) are clearly called out with rationale.
